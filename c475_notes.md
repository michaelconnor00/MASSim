## Questions

* RMAPAgent, line 512: where does the cost for communicaiton get removed? (applies to RMAP_TBAgent, and re-plan)
* RMAP_TBAgent, line 430: does it make sense to help another agent whose has a lesser wellbeing?
* Looks like ResourceMAP_TBAgent line 316/323/329 are removing helpoverhead when it was already removed when the bid was made.
