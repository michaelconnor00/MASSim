1. For communication, should the agents call the communication medium's send 
method from the team object or the send method provided by the team class so 
that the communication medium will be transparent to the agents.


2. Possibly there can be a Message class, which gets the message string and 
decodes it into its fields, or vice versa. The question is how efficient is
that.

3. As during the simulator itself, we don't need the concept of color, and
the enums in Java are not interpreted as ints, it might be better to use
int to represent the color of the cells, so that we can use simpler data
structures. Just in the frontend and for presentation, we can map these
ints to colors.
The downside to this is that use of int may lead to accidental programming
errors, as the value of the cell can be practically any int, which may not
necessarily represent a color.
